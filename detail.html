        2019 and Veronica Maggio is undeniably Swedens queen of pop since many
        years, and the biggest local artist. Despite lyrics sung in Swedish, a
        language spoken by no more than 10 million, Veronicas songs have
        managed to stream upwards of 700 million (!) times on Spotify.
        Veronica first showed up on the Swedish music scene in 2006 with her
        debut single “Dumpa Mig” (break up with me), one could sense that
        something unique was taking shape. Her style of lyric-writing was
        significantly different from the tradition of swedish pop lyrics up to
        date. A sort of “write about what you see”-perspective based on
        herself, her childhood and not so seldom about her shortcomings. Pop
        music with huge choruses but revealing a darkness.
